# Spam-mail-prediction
Spam Mail Prediction is an important application of machine learning, which involves building a model to detect spam mails. By using supervised learning techniques, we aim to accurately classify emails as either spam (0) or legitimate (1). Logistic Regression is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms used for this task.

## Key steps
1. **Importing Dependencies:** We begin by importing essential libraries and tools needed for the project.
2. **Data Collection and Pre-processing:** We gather a dataset of emails, ensuring it's clean and ready for analysis.
3. **Splitting Data:** The dataset is divided into two parts: one for training the model and the other for testing its accuracy.
4. **Feature Extraction:** We transform the text content of emails into a format that the machine learning model can understand.
5. **Training the Model:** Using the training data, we teach the model to recognize the patterns of spam and non-spam (ham) emails. We use a machine learning technique called Logistic Regression for this purpose.
6. **Evaluating the Trained Model:** We test the model's accuracy and effectiveness in identifying spam emails using the separate test data.
7. **Building a Predictive System:** The trained model is integrated into a system that can automatically label incoming emails as spam or ham, making your email experience safer and more efficient.

  
The overall goal of this project is to develop a system that can automatically identify and filter out spam emails from a collection of incoming emails. This project aims to enhance email security, reduce the clutter in users' inboxes, and improve the overall email experience.
